Work-Day-Calendar:

Description:
This repo is for the Module 5 Challenge to create a calendar
that shows the current day, month and date using dayjs. This calendar
also uses local storage to store user input in the specific time-blocks. 
It also uses the dayjs 24 hour time to compare with the various time-blocks
of stated hour of day to change the background colors to accurately represent 
the current status of either past, present, or future by adding of removing the 
classes of the individual time-blocks. 

Process:
This challenge has really taught me quite a bit about jQuery, the DOM, local storage
and github. I initially had some issues with the starter code and not realizing the correct 
way to work with it locally. Because after working on it for awhile I went to commit and push some 
changes to main and they went to crispy-octo-meme instead of my github repo...that of course didn't work
out. Once I got that issue delt with it took some time and effort to navigate using dayjs to affect the
changes to the time-block class status. I got some raelly good help from my tutor Juan Santiago, who 
helped me get more familiar with jQuery and helped me deal with a couple issues with setting up dayjs.
Also I got some assistance from my TA Jin Yi, who helped me work out an issue with local storage. So
I definately received some good guidance and googled the documentation and reviewed some class activity
material, stack overflow, geeks for geeks etc.. Great project and I'm happy to finally get it to a 
place where I can submit it.
